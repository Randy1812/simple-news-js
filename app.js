        "title":"States warned of ‘aggressive’ infiltration by terrorists along Afghan border",
        "by":"S.Vijay Kumar",
        "content": "The Union Government has warned of possible infiltration by battle-hardened militants into India along the Afghanistan border taking advantage of the weak and porous security systems there.Highly placed official sources told The Hindu in Chennai on September 5 that a Central agency, in an alert sent to all States and Central Armed Paramilitary Forces, has cautioned that armed terrorists owing allegiance to ISIS-K, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed could attempt to aggressively infiltrate into India, particularly Jammu & Kashmir.Pointing to various instances of security concerns in Afghanistan, including the explosions at the Kabul airport, that could have a bearing on the security scenario in India, the alert said developments in the neighbouring country were seen as a victory to puritanical Islam. This could embolden and reinforce the ideologies of leaders of various banned outfits in India who might provoke their cadres to derail public order, the sources said. While India was not affected by the activities of Foreign Terrorist Fighters, the situation in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime might pave the way for convergence of radical sentiments and bring together armed fighters from other areas to pursue common goals. Security system had become extremely porous after the U.S. armed forces fully withdrew from the war-torn country, the sources said. Besides the congregation of trained militants who were equipped with improvised explosive devices and sophisticated weaponry, the release of prisoners lodged in jails, including several foreign nationals, was also a matter of concern since it would revive organised crimes with trans-national network like smuggling of drugs, counterfeit Indian currency, weapons etc., the sources said.States were told to brief security personnel guarding VVIPs about the escalation in threat perceptions. While cybercrime police were asked to intensify vigil on social medial platforms and curtail the spread of communally sensitive content, emphasis was laid on strengthening of surveillance in areas of public gathering since the possibility of the infiltration of suicide bombers could not be ruled out.CAPFs protecting vital installations across the country would coordinate with the State administration in enhancing the security arrangements based on the perceived threat level. Security along the international land border and coastal districts would also be strengthened with adequate check-points, combing operations in vulnerable areas and intensified patrolling, the sources said.States with Israeli establishments and Jewish settlements were also alerted to deploy additional manpower in view of a potential threat of terror attack during the forthcoming Jewish holidays in the third week of September. Security personnel were advised to conduct anti-sabotage checks in and around Israeli embassy/Consulate and also enforce strict access-control measures to the foreign missions, the sources said.According to police sources, there was intelligence input on Afghanistan-Pakistan based IS operatives coordinating with their associates in India to carry out a terror attack. The input also said that the Foreign Terrorist Fighters offered to fund terror activities in India and arrange supply of sophisticated weapons, explosives etc.Though the input did not point to any specific target, police have scaled up security detail for important places of worship, leaders of some Hindu organisations and other sensitive establishments based on previous intelligence assessments, the sources added."

        "by":"PTI",
        "content":"President Ram Nath Kovind arrived in Goa on Sunday for his three-day-long visit to the state, during which he is scheduled to take part in an event organised by the Navy. An aircraft carrying Mr. Kovind arrived at Dabolim airport in the afternoon, from where he was flown in a helicopter to Bambolim helipad. He was welcomed by state Deputy Chief Minister Chandrakant Kavlekar and Protocol Minister Mauvin Godinho there. Mr. Kovind will present the President's Colour to naval aviation on Monday morning during the event being hosted by INS Hansa, a naval air station located near Dabolim.'The event coincides with the diamond jubilee of INS Hansa and the liberation of Goa,' a Navy spokesman said in a media release here. The Naval Jet Flight set up at Coimbatore in 1958 with Sea Hawk, Alize and Vampire aircraft, was later commissioned as INS Hansa on September 5, 1961. After the liberation of Goa, Dabolim airfield was taken over by the Navy in April 1962 and INS Hansa was shifted to Dabolim in June 1964. 'Commissioned as a modest air station with only a few aircraft, INS Hansa has increased its prowess over the last six decades and is presently operating over 40 military aircraft, clocking an average yearly flying of over 5,000 hours. The air station also supports civil aviation by handling domestic and international flights 24x7, with an average of 29,000 flights in a year,' the spokesman said. INS Hansa is the abode of the Indian Navy's frontline air squadrons - INAS 310 'Cobras' with Dornier-228 aircraft, INAS 315 'Winged Stallions' with the long range maritime patrol aircraft IL-38SD, INAS 339 'Falcons' with the airborne early warning Kamov-31 helicopter; INAS 303 'Black Panthers' and INAS 300 ' White Tigers' with the supersonic carrier-borne MiG 29K fighters, and INAS 323 'Harriers' with ALH Mk III helicopters, he said. 'The air station will soon operate the Boeing P8I long range maritime reconnaissance aircraft with the commissioning of INAS 316,' the spokesman added."

        "by":"Krishnadas Rajagopal",
        "content":"A Special Bench of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana said it was “not interested in a confrontation” with the government but the court was running out of patience and the Centre should conform and fill long-pending vacancies to key tribunals by the next hearing on September 13. The Bench, also comprising Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and L. Nageswara Rao, said tribunals across the country were on the verge of collapse. Cases were being adjourned by a year. Many tribunals operated with just one member as no appointments had been made for months, if not years. “You have no respect for the judgments of this court… You are testing our patience,” Chief Justice Ramana addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the government, on Monday. The court said it had three options. One, close the tribunals. Two, to itself make the appointments. Three, to initiate contempt. “Everybody is happy with the quick way in which the government cleared the Supreme Court appointments… We do not want any confrontation with the government. But if you can so quickly make appointments to the Supreme Court, you can very well do so with these small tribunals. The tribunals have virtually collapsed… Why are you being so particular about the tribunals?” Chief Justice Ramana asked Mr. Mehta."

        "by":"REUTERS",
        "content":"Carlos Alcaraz became the youngest player in the Open era to reach the quarter-finals of the men's tournament at Flushing Meadows after the 18-year-old Spaniard beat Germany's Peter Gojowczyk 5-7 6-1 5-7 6-2 6-0 on Sunday. Alcaraz, who is 18 years and four months old, is eight days younger than Andre Agassi when the American reached the 1988 U.S. Open quarter-finals and semi-finals, according to U.S. Open stats. The Spaniard is also the youngest to reach this stage in New York since Brazilian Thomaz Koch in 1963, five years before the sport turned professional, when the tournament was known as the U.S. Championships. Gojowczyk, 14 years older than Alcaraz and playing in the fourth round of a major for the first time, made a bright start to edge the first set, but was hampered by an injury to his thigh and took a medical timeout midway through the fourth. The German fought hard but faded badly as the match wore on, labouring behind the baseline as Alcaraz closed out the match with a bagel in the decider, sealing victory in three hours, 31 minutes when Gojowczyk sent a forehand sailing long. Alcaraz smashed 35 winners and seven aces while winning 15 points at the net, feeding off the energy of the vocal crowd on Grandstand, while his opponent ended the match with a whopping 84 unforced errors. Next up for the Spaniard is either American Frances Tiafoe or 12th-seeded Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime."

        "by":"Legal Correspondent",
        "content":"The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to the Centre’s request to adjourn the hearing of petitions for an independent probe into allegations of the government using Israeli-based Pegasus spyware to snoop on citizens.A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India N.V. Ramana stood over the hearing to September 13 after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said he could not meet with officials to discuss the issue.Mr. Mehta indicated that the government may be filing an affidavit in the case, and he needed time to meet with the officials concerned. Earlier, in August, the government had filed a two-page affidavit denying “all and any allegations”.“Haven’t you already filed an affidavit?” the CJI referred to the August affidavit. Mr. Mehta submitted that the court had left it open for the government to file another, detailed affidavit, if necessary. The court had issued pre-admission in the case on August 17. In fact, on that day, the government had argued against a public hearing of the case, citing national security concerns. The Centre had asked the court, instead, to allow it to form an independent committee of experts to look into Pegasus snooping reports.“As a responsible government, we are submitting that we will form a Committee of neutral experts, whose report will be placed before the Supreme Court… I repeat, it is not my case that I will not divulge anything. All will be revealed before the Committee… Let me do that before a Committee… Permit us to form a Committee… We will place its report before the Supreme Court itself,” Mr. Mehta had urged the court on August 17. The court had, however, made it clear that there was no question of compromising national security. “We are not going to ask you to divulge anything that will harm the defence of the nation… We are extremely reluctant to say anything on that. But the question here is that there are some persons of eminence who have come here, saying there has been interception of their phones… That can be done, but with the permission of the competent authority… What is the problem if that competent authority filed an affidavit before us? In the affidavit we don’t want a single word on any aspect that relates to the security of the nation... All we are saying is that we are issuing simple notice… Let the competent authority say to what extent what information can be disclosed,” Justice Surya Kant had explained."

        "title":"Djokovic beats last American at U.S. Open to extend Slam bid",
        "by":"PTI",
        "content":"For half an hour and a full set at the start, then one particularly compelling and competitive game later, Novak Djokovic's opponent in the U.S. Open's fourth round, Jenson Brooksby, gave him fits and created a raucous atmosphere under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium. That let Djokovic, above all, and everyone else, too, know that Brooksby — a 20-year-old wild-card entry from California who is ranked 99th and never before had been on this sort of stage — belonged. And then, not surprisingly, Djokovic showed why he is who he is and how he's managed to move within three victories of the first calendar-year Grand Slam in men's tennis in 52 years. Settling in and sending messages, to the fans with roars and to Brooksby with some staredowns, No. 1 Djokovic improved to 25-0 in majors this year by winning 1-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 on Monday night. He extended his pursuit of a true Slam and a record-breaking 21st major championship while also eliminating the lastA merican singles player in the tournament. It is the first time in the history of an event that dates to the 1880s that no man or woman from the host country reached the quarterfinals. One key to the turnaround by Djokovic, as good a returner as there is: He broke in Brooksby's initial service game in each of the last three sets. Perhaps affected by the physical nature of the extended exchanges, Brooksby was visited by a trainer after the second set and again after the third. Still, for someone who never had set foot on Ashe's blue court until about two hours before the match, when he got a chance to practice there, Brooksby never seemed overwhelmed by the setting or the circumstances. “A very young, very talented player,” Djokovic said. “I told him at the net a bright future is ahead of him.” His 6-foot-4 strides and reach, his anticipation, his variety including a well-disguised two-handed backhand slice, his think-steps-ahead point construction, his commitment to patterns drawn up by his coach at home in Sacramento since age 7, Joe Gilbert — all left Djokovic a tad discombobulated early. “It wasn't a great start for me. Obviously, Jenson was pumped. He had a clear game plan. He was executing all the shots efficiently. I was on my back foot,” said Djokovic, who is trying to be the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win all four Slam trophies in one year and also aiming to eclipse the men's mark of 20 career majors he shares with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. “He was reading the play very well.” In the first set, Brooksby made one unforced error, Djokovic 11. And Brooksby won 14 of the points that lasted five strokes or more, Djokovic four. When Djokovic netted an overhead to move Brooksby two points from the set, most of the spectators in the 23,000-plus-capacity arena — excited to be back after last year's ban on audiences amid the pandemic — rose, clapping and screaming. When Djokovic missed a return to cede that set to his foe, Brooksby waved both arms and heard more loud support. “Electric. Awesome. I enjoyed it. I truly did,” said Djokovic, who soon would be hearing his own cheers. “The momentum,” declared Djokovic, a 34-year-old from Serbia, “was changed.” He next meets No. 6 Matteo Berrettini of Italy in a rematch of the Wimbledon final."

        "content":"The cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the country crossed the 70 crore mark on Tuesday. The last 10 crore doses were given in just 13 days, the fastest so far, the Union Health Ministry said. Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare Mansukh Mandaviya on Twitter congratulated all the health workers and public for the “momentous achievement”.The seven-day average number of doses administered daily has been consistently improving since August-end. The average daily doses have improved from around 50 lakh in mid-August to 83 lakh at the end of September first week. To fully vaccinate all adults by 2021, over 1 crore vaccinations have to be done every day in the remaining days. So far, this mark has been crossed on three days — August 27 (1.07 crore), August 31 (1.35 crore) and September 6 (1.15 crore). On Tuesday, as of 7 p.m., 72,40,929 doses have been administered. The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16, with healthcare workers (HCWs) getting inoculated in the first phase. The vaccination of frontline workers (FLWs) started from February 2. The next phase commenced from March 1 for people over 60 years and those aged 45 and above with specified comorbid conditions. The country launched vaccination for all people aged more than 45 years from April 1. The government then expanded the drive by allowing everyone above 18 to be vaccinated from May 1. As on Tuesday, 56.6% of the Indian adult population has been vaccinated with at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Also, 17.4% of the adult population has been vaccinated with both doses. In eight States/Union Territories (UTs), including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand, the share of adults with at least one dose administered remains below the 50% mark. In nine States/UTs, including Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim, the share has increased beyond the 80% mark. In 17 States/UTs, including Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Maharashtra, the share of adults with both the doses administered remains below the 20% mark. In seven States/UTs, the share has increased beyond the 30% mark"

Mr. Farzad, an ethnic Hazara from Ghazni, has a residence in Kabul where he has been staying pending his return to the SAU. According to sources in the SAU, there are several Afghan students in the Departments of Sociology and Economics who were unable to return because of the situation in Kabul.

        "content": "Apple Inc said on Tuesday it would hold a special event on Sept. 14, which most industry watchers believe will be used to unveil a new line of its flagship iPhones.Since 2013, Apple has delivered new iPhones around September like clockwork. The tech giant, which launched a redesigned iPhone with 5G connectivity last year, is not expected to make radical changes this year, with most analysts pointing to small technical updates to the phone's processor and camera system. 'Upgrades rates peaked in 2021 on 5G, we expect upgrade rates to moderate but still drive high volumes in 2022,' J.P.Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note, adding that he still expects a record year thanks to higher sales of the lower priced iPhone SE. The new line of smartphones are expected to expand the Portrait mode feature to video and also have higher-quality video recording format, according to a Bloomberg report. The Portrait mode uses the phone's depth sensor to focus on faces while blurring the background, allowing amateur photographers to produce high-quality snaps. Apple was not immediately able to comment beyond the invitation sent to the mediA look at Apple's high and low points in 2020.The mid-September launch results in a sales surge in the last week of Apple's fiscal fourth quarter as millions of avid shoppers snap up the newly releases iPhones. Last year, however, the event got delayed by a month because of the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning opening-weekend iPhone sales were not included in fourth-quarter results. The event also helps Wall Street analysts model their sales projections for the holiday shopping season in Western markets, typically Apple's largest sales quarter. Known for its splashy phone launches packed with hundreds of journalists at its sprawling campus in Cupertino, California, Apple has turned to virtual events since last year because of the pandemic."

'WhatsApp provides a way for people to report spam or abuse, which includes sharing the most recent messages in a chat. This feature is important for preventing the worst abuse on the internet. We strongly disagree with the notion that accepting reports a user chooses to send us is incompatible with end-to-end encryption,' a WhatsApp spokesperson said.The spokesperson added that in India, in accordance with the government's IT rules, it also publishes monthly reports that contain details of how WhatsApp keeps users safe and prevents abuse on the platform on the basis of these user reports. 'WhatsApp remains deeply committed to privacy and user-safety,' the spokesperson said. In the past too, there have been instances when concerns were raised about privacy of conversations on WhatsApp. The company, on its part, has always maintained that all messages and calls on the platform are end-to-end encrypted and that it has no visibility on the content.The 594 user reports spanned across account support (137), ban appeal (316), other support (45), product support (64) and safety (32) during June 16-July 31. During this period, 74 accounts were 'actioned', as per the report. 'Accounts Actioned' denotes reports where the platform took remedial action based on the report. Taking action denotes either banning an account or a previously banned account being restored as a result of the complaint. The company has previously said that apart from 'behavioural signals' from accounts, it relies on available “unencrypted information” including user reports, profile photos, group photos and descriptions as well as advanced AI tools and resources to detect and prevent abuse on its platform."
